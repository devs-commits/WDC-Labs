<!-- 
Why Interns Need Help Writing Professional Messages

Because WDC Labs is not just a place where interns complete tasks —
it’s preparation for real-world work environments.

In real companies, interns must communicate:

with teammates

with supervisors

with clients

with mentors

with project leads

If they cannot write clearly and professionally, they will struggle even if they’re technically good.
