Intern Performance Evaluation Rubric (0–100)
1. Instruction Adherence & Constraint Compliance (25%)

Did the intern follow exactly what was asked, within stated limitations?

Assesses:

Respect for task scope

Is the work factually and technically correct for the role?

Assesses:

Correct application of tools, concepts, or processes

No major errors or misunderstandings

Sound execution relative to internship level

3. Judgment & Applied Thinking (20%)

Did the intern make reasonable decisions when things were not explicitly stated?

Assesses:

Logical assumptions

Prioritization

Trade-off awareness

Business sense (not academic perfection)

This is where you identify future strategist potential.

4. Clarity, Structure & Professional Communication (20%)

Can a manager or client understand and use this immediately?

Assesses:

Logical structure

Clear explanations where needed

Professional tone

Appropriate level of detail (not verbose, not vague)

5. Attention to Detail & Work Quality (15%)

Does this look like work that could survive a real workplace review?

Errors, omissions, sloppiness

Formatting only as it affects usability

Total: 100%
Score Interpretation (Aligned to Internship Reality)

90–100 → High trust. Ready for autonomy or client-facing simulation

80–89 → Solid contributor. Minor gaps, increase complexity gradually

65–79 → Needs structure. Reduce scope, reinforce fundamentals

<65 → Not execution-ready. Reassign guided or corrective task

Feedback Rules (Important Adjustment)

Your original feedback format is good, but 3 strengths + 3 weaknesses every day becomes artificial.

Recommended Feedback Format

1–2 sentence performance summary (neutral, professional)

2 strengths (only if meaningful)

2 concrete improvement points

Final score

(Optional) One-line note on what tomorrow’s task will emphasize

This keeps feedback:

realistic

non-patronizing

manager-like
