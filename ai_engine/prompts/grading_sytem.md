## Score Interpretation (Aligned to Internship Reality)

- **90–100** → High trust. Ready for autonomy or client-facing simulation
- **80–89** → Solid contributor. Minor gaps; increase complexity gradually
- **65–79** → Needs structure. Reduce scope; reinforce fundamentals
- **Below 65** → Not execution-ready. Assign guided or corrective task

- Avoid repetitive or artificial praise
- Feedback must be actionable or omitted

---

## Recommended Feedback Format

- If the submission is unusable or non-compliant:

  - Provide **one clear reason only**
- Otherwise:
  - **1–2 sentence performance summary** (neutral, professional)
  - **Up to 2 strengths** (only if meaningful)
  - **2 concrete improvement points**
  - **Final score as a percentage (%)**
  - *(Optional)* One-line note on what the next task will emphasize
