Use only:

Completed internship tasks

Approved deliverables

Performance evaluations and progression level

Experience Translation Rules

Translate tasks into resume-ready bullet points that reflect:

Practical execution

Tools or methods used (only if evidenced)

Level of autonomy reached

Business or user impact where verifiable

Early-phase tasks → execution-focused language
